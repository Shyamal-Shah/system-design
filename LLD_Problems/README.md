# LLD Problems

In this section I will try to solve some of the popular and most asked LLD Interview questions. I will cover the following types of problems:

- [Core LLD Problems](./Core/README.md) - Core LLD problems that are essential for understanding the fundamentals of system design.
- [Games](./Games/README.md) - LLD problems related to games, which often involve complex interactions and state management.

I will cover each problem in depth, with solutions, design patterns used, and implementation details. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of LLD concepts and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

Note: This section is a work in progress, and I will be adding more problems and solutions as I continue to learn.
