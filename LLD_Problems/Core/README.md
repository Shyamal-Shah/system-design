# Core LLD Problems

I will cover various core LLD problems that are essential for understanding the fundamentals of system design. These problems will help you grasp the core concepts and principles of LLD, which can be applied to various real-world scenarios.

I will cover the following core LLD problems:

- [Parking Lot](./Parking_Lot/README.md)

Each problem will be explained with:

- Very Basic Initial Requirements
- Follow-up Questions you can ask to the interviewer
- Final Requirements and Additional Constraints
- Design Overview
- Implementation in TypeScript
- Design Patterns Used

More core LLD problems will be added here progressively to build a strong design foundation.
