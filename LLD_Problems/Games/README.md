# LLD of Games

I will cover various low level designs of games that often involve complex interactions and state management. These problems will help you understand how to design systems that can handle multiple entities, their interactions, and the game logic effectively.

I will cover the following LLD problems related to games:

- [TicTacToe](./TicTacToe/README.md)

Each problem will be explained with:

- Very Basic Initial Requirements
- Follow-up Questions you can ask to the interviewer
- Final Requirements and Additional Constraints
- Design Overview
- Implementation in TypeScript
- Design Patterns Used

More LLD problems related to games will be added here progressively to build a strong design foundation.
