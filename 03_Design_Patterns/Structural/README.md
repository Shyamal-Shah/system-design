# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are generally used to define how the classes and objects in the system are created and integrated into a larger system. The key in structural design patterns is to identify the relationships of the classes at the lowest level and build the system from the bottom up. This allows us to create a system that is flexible, maintainable, and scalable.

I will cover various structural design patterns, including the following:

- [Decorator](./Decorator/README.md)
- [Proxy](./Proxy/README.md)

Each pattern will be explained with:

- A clear definition of the pattern.
- A real-world scenario where the pattern can be applied.
- An example of how the pattern can be implemented.
- An explanation of why the pattern is useful.
