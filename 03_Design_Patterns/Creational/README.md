# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are generally used to define how to create objects in the system, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. The key in creational design patterns is to hide the object creation and composition of objects, and provide a way to create objects in a way that is independent of the client code. This allows us to create a system that is flexible, maintainable, and scalable.

I will cover various Creational design patterns, including the following:

- [Factory](./Factory/README.md)
- [Abstract Factory](./Abstract_Factory/README.md)
- [Singleton](./Singleton/README.md)
- [Prototype](./Prototype/README.md)
- [Builder](./Builder/README.md)

Each pattern will be explained with:

- A clear definition of the pattern.
- A real-world scenario where the pattern can be applied.
- An example of how the pattern can be implemented.
- An explanation of why the pattern is useful.
