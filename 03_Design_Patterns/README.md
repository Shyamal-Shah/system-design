# Design Patterns

In software engineering, writing code is just one part of the job. Understanding the structure and the design of the code is equally important, especially when working on the existing large codebases which most of us do. Design patterns are basically an template or principles in the world of Object-Oriented Programming.

By employing these design patterns in our code, we can create software that is easier to maintain, extend, and understand. Design patterns are generalized concepts and solutions to tackle common problems that arise in every software early if not later.

I will try to cover various categories of design patterns solving different problems and scenarios, including:
