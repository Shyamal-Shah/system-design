# HLD Concepts

Before diving into the specifics of High-Level Design (HLD) concepts, it's essential to understand the foundational elements that guide the design of complex systems. These concepts provide a framework for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient software systems.

I will try to cover various categories of HLD concepts, including:
