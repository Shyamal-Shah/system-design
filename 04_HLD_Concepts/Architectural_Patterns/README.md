# Architectural Patterns

I will be covering various architectural patterns that are essential for designing scalable, maintainable, and efficient software systems. Understanding these patterns will help make informed decisions about how to structure applications and choose the right technologies.

I will try to cover various categories of architectural patterns, including:

- [Monolithic Architecture](Monolithic.md) - The application is built as a single unit, with all the components integrated together.
- [Microservice Architecture](Microservice/README.md) - The application is built using many individual unit, with each component handling specific functionality.
