# System Design

👋 **Welcome to my System Design repository!**

This repository is designed to help both myself and others learn and understand the principles of system design. It will cover a wide range of topics as I progress through my learning journey.

### 🌟 What makes this repository unique?

I aim to explain each concept in a way that is easy to understand – **as if I’m explaining it to a friend**. You will find:

✅ Real-world examples and practical applications  
✅ Code snippets and implementations wherever relevant  
✅ Clear explanations focusing on _why_ something is designed a certain way, not just _how_
